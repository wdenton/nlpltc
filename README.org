#+author: William Denton <william@williamdenton.org>

* About

This generates a nice-looking printed catalogue for a [[https://www.librarything.com/home#][LibraryThing]] library.

Example:

#+caption: Example from the Arts and Letters Club catalogue
[[./nlpltc-sample.png]]

* Usage

First, obtain a CSV export from your LibraryThing collection: [https://www.librarything.com/more/import](https://www.librarything.com/more/import)

Then:

    $ nlpltc your-lt-export.csv > catalogue.tex
    $ pdflatex catalogue.tex

That will produce =catalogue.pdf=.

* Requirements

LaTeX!  The [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]] distribution should include everything you need.

Also [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]]. You will also need some gems, which you can install this way:

#+begin_src shell
bundle install
#+end_src

* History

Written for the [Hackfest at Access 2010 (15 October 2010, Winnipeg MB)](http://access2010.lib.umanitoba.ca/node/3.html).

Thanks to Hackfest project partners: Ganga Dakshinamurti, Wendy Huot, and Rebecca Larocque. Chris Charles found and fixed a bug at Hackfest at Code4Lib North (6 May 2011, Hamilton ON).

* To Do

+ Automate the getting of the export file (if you know a cookie?)
+ Make it look the way Wendy specified (fonts/indenting)
+ Do a subject listing, by tag
