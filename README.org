* About

This generates a nice-looking printed catalogue for a [[https://www.librarything.com/][LibraryThing]] library.

Example (generated from the [[https://artsandlettersclub.ca/][Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]] library):

* Requirements

+ LaTeX.  The [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]] distribution should include everything you need.
+ [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]] (and some gems).

* Installation

Download the source tree and run the test to make sure it all works.

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/wdenton/nlpltc.git # Not using using your GitHub account
git clone git@github.com:wdenton/nlpltc.git # Using your GitHub account
cd nlpltc
bundle install # To install necessary Ruby gems
make test
#+end_src

Ignore the LaTeX warnings about overfull or underfull hboxes.  If it says =Transcript written on catalogues/test/test-catalogue.log= then it succeeded.  View =catalogue/test/test-catalogue.pdf= to see the example PDF.

* Usage

To make your own catalogue, make a copy of one of the two existing catalogues, and edit the =erb= template file as needed.  For example, this would set things up so you would have a new catalogue template to edit:

#+begin_src shell
cd catalogues
cp -r test mylib
cd mylib
mv test.tex.erb mylib.tex.erb
#+end_src

Next, obtain a [[https://www.librarything.com/export.php?export_type=json][JSON export from your LibraryThing collection]].  We'll assume it's called =librarything_mylib.json=.  Move it into the =mylib= directory.  Then from the top directory of this source tree, run

#+begin_src shell
./nlpltc -i catalogues/mylib/librarything_mylib.json -t catalogues/mylib/mylib.tex.erb -o catalogues/mylib/mylib-catalogue.tex
pdflatex -output-directory catalogues/mylib mylib-catalogue.tex
#+end_src

Then view =catalogues/mylib/mylib-catalogue.pdf=.

For regular use, edit =Makefile= and add a ~mylib~ entry so you can just run ~make mylib~.

* History

Written for the Hackfest at the 2010 [[https://accessconference.ca/][Access conference]] (15 October 2010, Winnipeg MB) ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20110208015457/https://access2010.lib.umanitoba.ca/][Wayback Machine archive]]).

Thanks to Hackfest project partners: Ganga Dakshinamurti, Wendy Huot, and Rebecca Larocque. Chris Charles found and fixed a bug at Hackfest at Code4Lib North (6 May 2011, Hamilton ON).

* To Do

+ Allow ~nlpltc mylib~ or the like, and it all just works.
+ Automate the getting of the export file (if you know a cookie?).
+ Do a subject listing, by tag.
